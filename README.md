## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Made using an API that requests Facility data from Nasa. From there I used a Weather API to return the weather for that facility. 

## Lessons Learned:

This was my go at using one API to request data from another and build something more complex. It took a bit but I got the syntax for this down and felt great about the project.
